Helicopter Prison Breaks – Exploratory Analysis
Overview

This notebook performs an exploratory analysis of helicopter prison breaks (data scraped from Wikipedia). It uncovers trends in time, geography, success rate, and escapee details.

1. Data Source & Collection

Data taken from Wikipedia – List of Helicopter Prison Escapes.

About 48 rows × 6 columns.

Challenges: possible underreporting, missing values (especially in Escapee(s) column), and bias by country.

2. Preparation & Cleaning

Used requests + BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse data.

Converted HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame.

Removed redundant columns, normalized characters (using unicodedata), and handled dates (using datetime).

Missing values addressed or dropped as needed.

3. Analysis Performed
a) Temporal Analysis

Count of escapes per year to see spikes or downward trends.

Monthly & weekday analysis to detect “when” escapes are more likely.

b) Geographical Analysis

Ranking of countries by number of helicopter escapes.

Highlights which regions face most helicopter escape incidents.

c) Success Analysis

Success rate vs failure rate of attempts.

Gives insight into how often escapes succeed.

d) Escapee Analysis

Average number of escapees per incident.

Identifying notorious inmates or repeat escapees.

4. Visualizations

Used matplotlib/pyplot to create graphs:

Yearly trends bar chart.

Country-wise frequency chart.

Success rate pie chart.

Average escapees per incident bar graph.

5. Key Insights

Certain years saw spikes in helicopter escapes.

Some countries dominate the list (France & Greece have high counts historically).

Not all attempts succeed—success rate analysis provides a benchmark.

Group escapes are rarer than single escapees.

6. Limitations

Wikipedia may not include all incidents worldwide.

Some data incomplete or ambiguous.

Trends could shift if dataset updated.

7. Conclusion

The notebook successfully shows patterns over time and by country.

It provides a framework to strengthen prison security measures.

Further work could include:

Statistical modeling to predict escape likelihood.
